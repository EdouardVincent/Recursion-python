Hello everyone,

Today I will show you how did I make substraction, addition, multiplication, division, facrotial, and power with only the functions preddecessor (-1) and successor (+1) in python with the recursivity. This way to do is called Peano's axioms. But I made it alone, I didn't search how to do on internet.
